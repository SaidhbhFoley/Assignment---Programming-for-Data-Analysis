    "NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open source Python library. NumPy is used across the majority of science and engineering fields. It has become the universal standard when it comes to working with numerical data<sup>1</sup>. NumPy performs the following operations<sup>2</sup>:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mathematical and logical\n",
    "2. Shape manipulation and Fourier transforms\n",
    "3. Basic linear algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "To use NumPy in Python you must use the command:\n",
    ">import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is a great alternative to Python lists. NumPy is up to fifty times faster than Python lists<sup>3</sup> and has the ability to work with large datasets more efficiently than Python lists. NumPy is often used in conjunction with other libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn<sup>4</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy works with large and often times multidimensional arrays (collections of values that can have one or more dimensions). ndarray (N-dimensional array) stores items that are of the same size and type. The items stored in a ndarray can be modified by indexing or slicing<sup>5</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important differences between NumPy arrays and Python lists are:\n",
    "- NumPy arrays have a fixed size when created. If the size is changed it results in the creation of a new array causing the original array to be deleted. \n",
    "- The items in a NumPy array must be the same data type, with the exception of object arrays which allows for different sized items.\n",
    "- NumPy arrays allow for advanced mathematical operations on large datasets which are executed in a more efficient manor than Python lists. \n",
    "- NumPy arrays are becoming more and more popular.\n",
