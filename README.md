# Programming for Data Analysis
Assignment for this module

## An Investigation into the numpy.random package

In this assignment I cover the following:

1. Explain the overall purpose of the package
2. Explain the use of the "Simple random data" and "Permutations" functions
3. Explain the use and purpose of at lease five "Distributions" functions
4. Explain the use of seeds in generation pseudorandom numbers

### 1. Overall Purpose of Package
In this section I give a brief overview of the overall purpose of the NumPy package. First looking into what is NumPy, then the benefits and why it used.

### 2. "Simple Random Data" and "Permutations Functions"
In this section I first explore the simple random data. I focused on the two most common and basic functions from this package: rand and randint.
I then looked into the three permutation functions: shuffle, permutation and permuted

### 3. Distribution Functions
The five distributions I choose to look into where:
1. binomial 
2. geometric 
3. normal 
4. poisson
5. uniform

### Seeds in Generating Pseudorandom Numbers
I briefly covered the basics of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers and the importance of seeds.
